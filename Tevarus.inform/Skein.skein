You are a newly appointed historian and your first job is to clean up the archives. This is where you stumble upon the ghost of Tevarus of Tanner, a former aristocrat with very little recorded history to his name. The only thing you remember about him is the fact that he died a traitor's death.

He does not seem dangerous and neither does he appear to have noticed you.



Tevarus
An attempt at IF by anonabelle
Release 1 / Serial number 241213 / Inform 7 v10.1.2 / D

Archives
The archives are located near the top of one of the smaller towers. Shelves high as the ceiling line the cylindrical walls, each of them crammed with records that are centuries old - and smells it. Maybe you should air out the room.

Seated at the single table by the window is Tevarus.

You are a newly appointed historian and your first job is to clean up the archives. This is where you stumble upon the ghost of Tevarus of Tanner, a former aristocrat with very little recorded history to his name. The only thing you remember about him is the fact that he died a traitor's death.

He does not seem dangerous and neither does he appear to have noticed you.

Your eyes widen and your heartbeat speeds up. Before you realize it, a blood-curdling scream rips out of your throat.

Tevarus is startled out of his seat, his surprised gaze intent on you. When you look back on this moment when you are significantly calmer, you think that he might have tried to say something to you. Right now, you are too hopped up on adrenaline to think about anything except that there is a ghost in the Archives.

 In a thrice, you are out of there and in the middle of the courtyard, clinging to your superiors and babbling about hauntings.

 Instead of sharing your horror, they sigh and reassign you to a different task.

You are a newly appointed historian and your first job is to clean up the archives. This is where you stumble upon the ghost of Tevarus of Tanner, a former aristocrat with very little recorded history to his name. The only thing you remember about him is the fact that he died a traitor's death.

He does not seem dangerous and neither does he appear to have noticed you.

An attempt at IF. by anonabelle
Release 1 / Serial number 241210 / Inform 7 v10.1.2 / D

Archives
The archives are located near the top of one of the smaller towers. Shelves high as the ceiling line the cylindrical walls, each of them crammed with records that are centuries old - and smells it. Maybe you should air out the room.

Seated at the single table by the window is Tevarus.

Your eyes widen and your heartbeat speeds up. Before you realize it, a blood-curdling scream rips out of your throat. 

  Tevarus is startled out of his seat, his surprised gaze intent on you. When you look back on this moment when you are significantly calmer, you think that he might have tried to say something to you. Right now, you are too hopped up on adrenaline to think about anything except that there is a ghost in the Archives. 

 In a thrice, you are out of there and in the middle of the courtyard, clinging to your superiors and babbling about hauntings. 

 Instead of sharing your horror, they sigh and reassign you to a different task.



    *** You have completed the Scared ending ***



Would you like to RESTART, RESTORE a saved game, QUIT or UNDO the last command?
